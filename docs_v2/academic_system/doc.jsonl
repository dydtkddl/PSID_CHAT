A. 수강학점철회는 이번 학기 수강 신청한 과목 중에서 일부 과목의 수강신청을 철회하는 것이며, 학점포기 신청은 기 취득한 성적 중 교육과정 개정으로 인하여 폐지되어 재수강이 불가능한 교과목이나 학점교류로 취득한 과목 등에 대하여 본인의 의사에 따라 포기하는 제도를 의미합니다. Q. 수강학점철회와 학점포기 신청기간은 언제인가요? A. 수강학점철회 신청은 매 학기 초(3월, 9월) 넷째 주에 실시되고, 학점포기 신청은 매 학기 초(3월, 9월) 셋째 주에 실시됩니다. 학생 본인이 직접 경희대학교 포털에 접속하여 신청하면 됩니다. Q. 수강학점철회는 최대 몇 학점까지 철회할 수 있나요? A. 학기당 최저 수강학점인 9학점 미만으로는 철회할 수 없습니다. 또한 해당 강좌의 수강인원이 폐강기준에 미달 되는 경우도 철회할 수 없습니다. Q. 수강신청한 과목을 철회한 후 다른 교과목으로 변경할 수 있나요? A. 변경할 수 없습니다. 또한 수강학점철회 기간 이후에는 수강 과목을 철회하거나 철회한 과목을 복원할 수 없습니다. Q. 경희사이버대학 강좌를 철회하고 싶습니다. A. 수강신청 확인 및 정정기간에 취소만 가능(신청불가)하며, 수강학점철회 기간에는 철회할 수 없습니다. Q. 수강학점철회 시 주의해야 할 사항이 있나요?

A. 수강학점철회 시 철회한 학점은 학기당 수강가능학점에 포함되므로 유의바랍니다.(예를 들어 해당학기 수강가능학점이 18학점인 학생이 18학점을 수강신청한 후 수강학점철회 기간에 3학점을 철회한 경우, 취득한 학점은 15학점이지만 18학점이 모두 사용한 것으로 간주됩니다.) 또한, 학점세이브, 성적우수 추가학점 부여 대상에서 제외됩니다. 2. 등록금 분할납부 Q. 전액장학금을 받았는데 가만히 있어도 등록이 되나요? A. 전액장학금 수혜자도 정상적인 등록을 해야 합니다. 0원 등록생(전액장학수혜자 등)의 경우 경희대학교 포털에서 0원 등록을 하시기 바랍니다. Q. 등록금 분할납부 신청기간과 방법이 궁금합니다. A. 매 학기 2월과 8월 등록금 납부기간에 공지사항이 올라오며 이때 신청기간이 있습니다. 경희대학교 포털에 로그인하여 ‘등록/ 장학’에서 ‘등록금분할납부신청’을 하면 됩니다. 반드시 신청하고 나서 등록금 납부기간 안에 1차 금액을 납부해야 분할납부 신청이 완료됩니다. Ⅶ. FAQ ◑ 105 Q. 분할납부 신청이 안 되는 경우는 어떤 건가요? A. 지난학기 분할납부 신청자 중 납부일자를 지키지 않은 학생은 신청할 수 없습니다. 등록하고자 하는 학기 전과 합격자는 신청 불가하며, 재입학자와 한국장학재단 학자금 대출 신청자는 신청 불가입니다. Q. 신입생도 분할납부가 가능한가요? A. 전과, 재입학, 편입학, 신입학 학생은 첫 등록학기에 분할납부 신청이 불가합니다. 두 번째 학기부터 신청할 수 있습니다. Q. 졸업유예자도 분할납부가 가능한가요? A. 10학점 이상 수강하는 경우(등록금 전액 납부)만 신청 가능합니다.
